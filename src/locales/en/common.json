  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about air quality monitoring and our sensors.",
    "question1": "How accurate are the air quality measurements?",
    "answer1": "Our sensors provide laboratory-grade accuracy with ±5% precision for PM2.5 measurements and ±3% for CO₂ levels. All sensors are calibrated using certified reference standards and undergo rigorous testing before deployment.",
    "question2": "What is the typical battery life for portable sensors?",
    "answer2": "The AirGuard Portable sensor offers up to 30 days of continuous monitoring on a single charge, with power-saving modes extending battery life to 60 days. Battery life varies based on measurement frequency and environmental conditions.",
    "question3": "Can I integrate the sensors with existing building management systems?",
    "answer3": "Yes, all our sensors support API integration and can connect to most building management systems (BMS), HVAC controls, and IoT platforms. We provide comprehensive documentation and SDKs for seamless integration.",
    "question4": "What maintenance is required for the sensors?",
    "answer4": "Our sensors are designed for minimal maintenance. The AirSense Home requires cleaning every 6 months, while industrial sensors may need calibration checks annually. All maintenance schedules are customizable through our dashboard.",
    "question5": "How do I set up alerts and notifications?",
    "answer5": "You can configure custom alerts through our mobile app or web dashboard. Set thresholds for any measured parameter, choose notification methods (email, SMS, push notifications), and specify who receives alerts for each location.",
    "question6": "What happens if a sensor goes offline?",
    "answer6": "If a sensor loses connectivity, you'll receive an immediate notification. The sensor continues collecting data locally and will sync all stored data once connectivity is restored. Data is never lost during outages.",
    "question7": "Is my data secure and private?",
    "answer7": "Absolutely. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and GDPR compliant, ensuring your air quality data remains private and secure.",
    "question8": "What support options are available?",
    "answer8": "We offer comprehensive support including 24/7 technical support, online documentation, video tutorials, and dedicated account managers for enterprise customers. Support is available via email, phone, and live chat."
